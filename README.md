# Tiny URL App
A four-day project to build my very first web app using Node. The app will allow users to shorten long URLs much like TinyURL.com and bit.ly do.

## Description and Functionality
Build an HTTP Server that handles requests from the browser (client). Utilize JavaScript, Node concepts, and Express.

- Control user login and registration
- Allow users to only create, view, edit and delete their own shortened URLs
- Encrypt user password and cookies during sessions
